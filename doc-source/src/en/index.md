features:
- title: Easy to use
  details: It is dependent on IDE prompts, and can be quickly mastered without documentation.
- title: Efficient
  details: Implementing using C++ and defaulting to multithreaded lazy loading of resources, its speed is ten to even hundreds of times faster than other tools of the same type.
- title: Cross-platform
  details: It is able to be used on various platforms, such as testing in Windows, Linux, or MacOS, and then moving the logic into the Android platform after testing is completed.

### Refuse tediousness

#### Demo App code

> This is a host app's obfuscated code, and we need to dynamically adapt the hook for this method. Due to obfuscation, the method name and class name may change with each version.
```java
public class abc {
    
    public boolean cvc() {
        boolean b = false;
        // ...
        Log.d("VipCheckUtil", "info: xxxx");
        // ...
        return b;
    }
}
```

dexkit can quickly meet our needs at this point.

#### Xposed hook code

> By creating an instance of `DexKitBridge`, we can search for specific dex in the APP, 
> but remember to only instantiate it once and avoid repeating the creation. And after using it, 
> we need to call the `DexKitBridge.close()` method to release the memory, otherwise it will cause memory leakage.
